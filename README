has_delegates
=============

Rails plugin/gem providing enhanced sub-model delegation to models.

This plugin implements all the small details to give you nice submodel
delegation.

Example
=======

There's two new class methods made available to ActiveRecord::Base:

* belongs_to_delegate(delegate_id, options => {})
* has_one_delegate(delegate_id, options = {})

Use it like this:

class Vcard < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :address
  has_one_delegate :address
end

You may now use all the attributes from the Address model in your Vcard
records.

The delegated to record will be created when one of it's attributes is
written to. It will be saved when the original record is saved.

It is possible to use more than one delegation per model.
